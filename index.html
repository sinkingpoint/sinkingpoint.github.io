          <div class="lightbox-content">
            <h3><a href="http://artifacts.sinkingpoint.com/Papers/nxcs-paper.pdf">NXCS</a></h3>
            While working as a research assistant at Victoria University, I underwent research
            with Dr Aaron Chen which resulted in the production of the learning algorithm
            NXCS (Natural-XCS), based on the reinforcement learning algorithm XCS, NXCS
            uses the "Natural" gradient (Proposal by Amari et al) to provide a better
            gradient descent approach to XCS on its own, allowing results for learning
            problems that require stochastic policies in optimality.

            <h3>Fuzzy-NXCS</h3>
            Again under Dr Aaron Chen, Fuzzy NXCS is an extention to our previous work which
            allows for continuous inputs and outputs through the use of Fuzzy Logic.

            <h3>Quarrel</h3>
            Quarrel is a pet project of mine which is a game engine, built from the
            window manager up. It basically serves as my attempt to learn how everything
            works, from the window manager up. Quarell includes libraries for loading
            images and displaying them on the screen, as well as input functionality
            and 3D graphics.

            <a href="https://github.com/sinkingpoint/balancepoint">Balancepoint</a> is a software HTTP load balancer
            I've been working on recently. It's designed to be as extensible as possible as well as maintaining
            the idea of cattle over pets - the general idea that instance discovery is a first class citizen
            and all configuration revolves around it, so any arbitrary group of servers has the same configuration.
            I'm aiming at things like Consul and EC2 support for service discovery etc, but really I just wanted tosee whether this
            sort of design would work. Also to finally get around to learning a bit of Go.

          <div class="lightbox-content">
            <h3>This Website</h3>
            This website comes with proper CI/CD. You'll find the repo
            over on <a href="https://github.com/sinkingpoint/sinkingpoint.github.io">github</a>
            and the Jenkins build at <a href="https://ci.sinkingpoint.com/job/quirl.co.nz/">My Jenkins Instance</a>.
            When commits are made to the feature branch at the above repo, they are pushed to <a href="https://test.quirl.co.nz">my staging environment</a>.
            CloudFlare (Which acts as a CDN for this site!) is set up to not cache anything for that subdomain, so changes
            are immediately visible. When commits are merged into the master branch, they will be pushed to
            the s3 bucket which governs this site and changes will be visible in up to half an hour as the cache flushes!
